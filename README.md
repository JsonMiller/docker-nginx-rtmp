# docker-nginx-rtmp

Simple project to setup an nginx rtmp server in a docker container.

Uses the Debian docker image and includes copies of nginx 1.24.0 and the nginx-rtmp-module version 1.2.2.

Configuration is handled by the nginx.conf file so play around in there, I don't think the template is going to do what I want, but I want it there just in case :D
